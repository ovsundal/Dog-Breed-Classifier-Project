# Dog-Vision-Project

This project is about building a dog breed classifier, inspired by this [kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification). All training and test data are from there. 

### To run the project
1. Download the project as a zip file (warning: all data is included - total size is ~760 MB)
2. Unzip and start the project (f.e. anaconda)
3. Open the "Dog vision classifier.ipynb"

(NB! If you do not have a GPU, training the network will take a very long time)
